# Student-performance-And-Attendence-Analysis-Using-PowerBI

# 📌1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive Student Performance and Attendance  Analytics Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will help educational institutions  understand student academic performance by analyzing marks, attendance wise results. This project focuses to converting large academic datasets into the  meaningful visual insights.

# 2. Problem Statement: 
## Background: 
Educational institutions maintain large amounts of student data, but this data are not 
analyzed effectively. Teachers usually depend on manual methods or final marks, which 
does not provide a complete picture of student performance. 
## Objective: 
To create interactive dashboards that analyze student performance, attendance impact, 
and subject-wise results. 
## Scope: 
The project focuses on student academic records, attendance data, and performance 
trends across departments and semesters. 
 
# 3. Data Sources: 
## Primary Data: 
Student academic performance dataset containing more than 10,000 records, including 
student details, subject-wise marks, attendance percentage, semester, and result status. 
## Secondary Data: 
Reference academic structures and standard grading patterns used by educational 
institutions. 
 
# 4. Methodology: 
Data Collection: Student performance and attendance data is collected in Excel format. 
Data Cleaning: Missing values and inconsistencies are handled using Power Query. 
Data Modeling: Relationships are created using Student ID across multiple tables. 
Dashboard Design: Interactive dashboards are created in Power BI with filters and KPIs. 
 
# 5. Expected Outcomes: - Interactive dashboards showing student performance trends - Identification of weak students and subjects - Clear understanding of attendance impact on results - Faster and data-driven academic decision-making 
 
# 6. Tools and Technologies:
- Microsoft Excel for data preparation
- Power BI for dashboard development
- Power Query for data transformation
- Basic DAX for calculations 
 
# 7. Risks and Challenges:
- Data quality issues such as missing or incorrect values
- Maintaining correct relationships between large datasets
- Ensuring dashboards remain simple and easy to understand 
 
## 8. Conclusion: 
This project helps educational institutions analyze student performance effectively using 
Power BI dashboards. By transforming large academic datasets into visual insights, the 
system supports better monitoring, planning, and early identification of students who 
need academic support.
